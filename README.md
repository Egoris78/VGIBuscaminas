# Buscamines
This was a project made for a subject in university called VGI(Visualitzacio Grafica Interactiva)
We made a 3D Minesweeper using OpenGL and Blender to create the objects that we use in the game.

This game has 2 modes:
- The classic one, you can move free and open the tiles you want util u get all tiles without a mine or u hit one.
- Path mode, in this mode you have to get to the other side of the field without hitting mines, we give u some extra lives so it's not that difficult to get to the other side.
